There are a log of people in my hyperlocal community that ask two things about me:

1. am I a Professional?
1. exactly where do I teach again? (No joke, they ask me that after I answered the first one)

On a few Thursdays over the past summer, I attended a few [Salsa on the Square](https://salsaonthesquare.com/) events. Normally, towards the end of the season, they hosted a competition for amateur salsa dancers to strut their stuff for a chance to win $1000. I also attend USA Dance monthly social events held by my local chapter (**shameless plug incoming:** I'm on the Board).

Contextually, it might not mean much, but as the final round of the salsa competition came around, my dance partner and I received an email stating we were disqualified on grounds of teaching, which to the rulemakers, is considered "pro". It is true that I have taught a few group lessons here and there for USA Dance chapters in the tristate area, but the fundamental question I want to address is the following:

**Does teaching other people automatically make you a professional dancer?**

According to NDCA rules, you are _technically_ allowed to teach as an Amateur. What defines a Professional status tends to be more of what you do in competitions: obviously, if you compete in the Professional events, you're a pro. Pro/Am as the _Professional_? You're a pro. Otherwise, you're an amateur. A lot of competitions will also have a division called Mixed Amateur which, to a reasonable suspicion, was created so that high level Amateurs could maintain their status while they teach on the side and compete with their students.

If we take the case of the Salsa community policy, maybe they got it got it right(?): if you teach, you're a pro. Period. I mean, how else would they be able to have a rule like that for the salsa competition? It would make the status of a person _learning_ and a person _learned_ much easier to distinguish.

If we take the case of the Ballroom community policy, if you dance _well_, you _may_ or _may not_ be a professional. However, when people dance _well_, there is a much higher chance that they've competed before. This is why I feel like it's a rarity for someone like me to show up at a dance social (note: my chapter *is* mainly a social chapter). And after dancing and progressing for so long, it would make sense that, in the general public eye, I look more like a professional.

I can't speak on behalf of the Swing community, but I'm sure they fall somewhere within what I've said above.

Granted, some may not agree with me, but after being in the industry for a long time, it's safe to say that in its fundamental structure, the way we go about giving someone a professional status is flawed.

More on this later.
