Sometimes it's inevitable to ask the question "why not go pro?" The way I view the world of dance experience is as follows.

To me, dance experience can be thought of like how Academia unfolds post-high school: when you enter college, you normally learn pre-requisite subjects before you specialize. This, in turn allows you to understand how many broad subjects derive knowledge into a more specific subject. While you are learning this, you go through a various levels of experience, such as your undergrad degree, graduate degree, and even post-graduate work/research. At any point in time, you may/may not get the chance to teach others more fundamental aspects of your field to others.

At what point of time would you decide you are "good enough" to teach others?

I argue that, while there will be good teachers on the Bachelor's and Master's level, ultimately my dance experience

I'm also sure my coahces would say otherwise, for dance "experience" could be more progressive than I make it out to be, and it only grows if you yearn it to, not matter if you are pro or not.
